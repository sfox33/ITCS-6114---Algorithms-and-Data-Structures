Homework.py is a Python program that produces all alternating or
double alternating sorts of the first n natural numbers.  This
code runs on Python 3, so it will probably produce errors if 
compiled with Python 2.

When the code is compiled, it will ask you for a value for the 
variable n.  This variable will be the size of the set to be examined.
For example, entering 3 will force the program to examine the set
{1,2,3}.

Afterwards, the program will ask you which type of sort you wish to 
find.  Entering 1 will print alternating sorts.  Entering 2 will
print double alternating sorts.  Any other number will cause
the program to default to printing alternating sorts.

The code will then do the rest and print out all sorts.  When all of
the sorts have been printed, it will also display the number of
sorts that have been found.

As far as I can tell, this code works for every natural number. 
However, after 12 or 13 are entered for values of n, it takes
a while to find all of the answers.  I have tested up to n=14.
